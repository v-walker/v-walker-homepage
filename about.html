            <p>What am I doing, and how did I get here? Great question!<br>
            I graduated from the University of Georgia (UGA) with my B.S.Ed. in Communication Sciences and Disorders (CMSD) in 2014 
            and my M.Ed. in CMSD in 2016. With a keen interest in child language development, I found a love of working with children 
            with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a speech-language pathologist (SLP) in the public school setting. Working with this 
            population involves unique challenges with regards to not only supporting language development, but also social 
            communication, as well as social-emotional skills. I found this field incredibly rewarding, but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic 
            and a move to remote learning, I found an interest in technology and the web. More specifically, I thought of all the technologies 
            I wish I knew how to create to better support my students.<br><br>
            Enter learning web development! In my youth, I enjoyed dabbling in HTML and CSS to build small sites via online games and MySpace 
            (remember Myspace??), so I knew I would find this field interesting, exciting, and challenging! So far, I have begun learning 
            command line tools, HTML5, CSS, Python3, and JavaScript. I plan to further my studies and experience via an Immersive Full-stack 
            Web Development bootcamp with Digital Crafts in September 2021.<br><br>
            I hope to create many useful tools for both the world and my colleagues in the field of speech-language pathology. Here's to learning,
            new experiences, and all the challenges that lie ahead!</p>
